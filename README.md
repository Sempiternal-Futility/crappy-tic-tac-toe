This is my first "real" project written with vim, so my idea with this was practicing vim, not building something easy-to-read and perform better, heck, it doesnt even need to be fun


you place your circle/X with 

"u", "i", "o"
                             
                             
"j", "k", "l"
                             
                             
"n", "m", ","
                             
                              

if you want to play this bad boy, open the shell of your os, cd to the game's directory (tic-tac-toe), and "dotnet run", if you have .net 6 runtime installed, you good
